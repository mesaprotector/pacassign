pacassign takes the following options:
	pacassign -h
		Shows this help text.
	pacassign FILEPATH... PACKAGE
		Assigns the given file(s) to the given package, which will be 
		removed if that package is uninstalled while no other package
		owns the file(s).
		pacassign -a is equivalent to this.
	pacassign -t FILEPATH... PACKAGE
		Assigns the given file to the given package (sticky), which will
		NOT be removed if the package is uninstalled, but the assignment
		will be reset.
		pacassign -at is equivalent to this.
	pacassign -r FILEPATH... PACKAGE
		Removes assignment of the given file(s) to the given package.
		TODO: If no package is specified all assignments of the file(s)
		will be removed.
	pacassign -o FILEPATH...
		Lists any package that owns or was assigned the given file(s).
		This is a superset of `pacman -Qo`. 
	pacassign -l [PACKAGE... ]
		Lists files manually assigned to the given packages, excluding
		sticky assignments. If no package is specified it will list 
		every file manually assigned through pacassign. 
	pacassign -lt [PACKAGE... ]
		The same as `pacassign -l`, but includes sticky assignments.
	pacassign -ll [PACKAGE... ]
		The same as `pacassign -lt`, but includes regular file ownership
		as listed by `pacman -Ql`.
